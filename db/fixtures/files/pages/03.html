<p class="lead">I've published a few gems, mostly to scratch some itches. They're very much works in progress.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/seaneshbaugh/kentouzu">Kentouzu</a>: Adds drafts to ActiveRecord models. Think paper_trail, but forward instead of backward.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/seaneshbaugh/rate_limiter">Rate Limiter</a>: A gem that limits the rate at which ActiveRecord model instances can be created.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/seaneshbaugh/rstat">RStat</a>: A very simple gem that extends some of the core Ruby classes (mostly Array) to give them statistical methods.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/seaneshbaugh/safety_check">Safety Check</a>: Selectively add type safety to your methods.</li>
</ul>
