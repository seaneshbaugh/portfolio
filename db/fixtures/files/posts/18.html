<p>In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;, asked Minsky.</p>
<p>&quot;I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-tac-toe&quot;, Sussman replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is the net wired randomly?&quot;, asked Minsky.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play&quot;, Sussman said.</p>
<p>Minsky then shut his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you close your eyes?&quot; Sussman asked his teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;So that the room will be empty.&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.</p>
